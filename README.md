# Module 18 challenge: Social Network API

## Description

This Module 18 Challenge repository was created to complete the Module 18 Challenge of the bootcamp.

This project aims to build the a MongoDB database using the Mongoose package for a social network system. The database stores the user,
their thoughts, the associated reactions and friend list. The application does not have an interface at the moment, so Insomnia need to
be used for route testing or demonstration, which a walkthrough video will be linked below in this README.  

## Installation

Please make sure to run the command "npm install" to install all required node modules before running the program. 

## Usage

Please run the command "npm start" in terminal to start the command-line application.
Please also use Insomnia for route testing.
